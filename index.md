This module helps to create an [AWS Batch stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/what-is-batch.html) within VPC. For more details about creating AWS Batch stacks, please see:
* [Terraform batch_compute_environment](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/batch_compute_environment)
* [Terraform batch_job_definition](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/batch_job_definition)
* [Terraform batch_job_queue](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/batch_job_queue)

## Standard architecture
A job definition specifies how jobs are to be runâ€”for example, which Docker image to use for your job, how many vCPUs and how much memory is required, the IAM role to be used, and more.

Jobs are submitted to job queues where they reside until they can be scheduled to run on Amazon EC2 instances within a compute environment. An AWS account can have multiple job queues, each with varying priority. This gives you the ability to closely align the consumption of compute resources with your organizational requirements.

Compute environments provision and manage your EC2 instances and other compute resources that are used to run your AWS Batch jobs. Job queues are mapped to one more compute environments and a given environment can also be mapped to one or more job queues. This many-to-many relationship is defined by the compute environment order and job queue priority properties.

The following diagram shows a general overview of how the AWS Batch resources interact.

## Requirements
|Name|Version|
|---|---|
|terraform | `>= 0.12.6`|
|aws| `>= 3.0.0`|

* VPC (*default/custom*) should be present.
* ECR and Docker image should be present.

## Usage

#### Get HashiCorp Terraform and Terraform AWS Provider
* [https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
* [https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws)

```hcl-terrarform
provider "aws" {
  region                  = "us-west-2"
  shared_credentials_file = "/Users/tf_user/.aws/creds"
  profile                 = "customprofile"
}
```
#### Instance the module from your Terraform code:

```hcl-terraform
module "aws-batch" {
  source                    = "fmdlc/aws-batch/module"
  version                   = "0.1.0"
  vpc_id                    = aws_vpc.main.id
  security_groups           = [aws_security_group.trusted.id]
  ce_name                   = "Demo-Compute-Environment"
  ecs_container_properties  = file("./data/job_definition.json")
}
```

### Expeced output
